          Born with Crimean Tatar roots, raised with stories of exile, music,
          and survival, I know the voice is more than sound—it's legacy. It’s
          how we carry the past, claim our space, and shape the future.{" "}
          <span class="font-semibold">—</span> From small village songs to
          Shakespearean stages, from scientific research labs to global speaker
          forums, my mission remains: To help every voice rise in power, truth,
          and freedom.
